# Changelog

## master

- Clean up `targetDirectory` before compilation

  This fixes a problem where artifacts from previous builds were linked with the newly compiled artifacts, which would usually result in linking errors.

  Eventually, this will be superseded by proper incremental compilation. For now, compiling with a clean state will at least ensure correct compilation.

## v0.0.2

- Add `scalaVersion` and `scalaJSVersion` options

  Previously, the plugin only worked with Scala.js 1.0.0 and Scala 2.13.1. You can now specify which version you want to use.

- Add `libraryDependencies` option

  With this new option, you can specify a list of Scala.js dependencies that Scala.js projects should be compiled with. For example:

  ```javascript
  {
    options: {
      libraryDependencies: ["com.lihaoyi::upickle:0.9.9"];
    }
  }
  ```

- Improve default logging output

  This ensures that relevant information is logged on default settings. Previously, the logger was perhaps too silent, which meant that on the first run, it would seem like nothing was happening.

## v0.0.1
